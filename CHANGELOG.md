# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

This is the first usable release.

### Added

- Orchestrator command for benchmarking multiple drives sequentially or in parallel
- Drive selection TUI with keyboard shortcuts (space to toggle, `a`/`n` for all/none)
- Resume capability for interrupted benchmark runs
- Interrupt handling with graceful shutdown
- Dry-run mode for the orchestrator
- Drive filtering options (`--include`, `--exclude`)
- Verbose mode for detailed execution output
- Web server GUI (`bbbench serve`) with live status, results browsing, and graph visualization
- Auto-refreshing status page during benchmark execution
- Persistent benchmark results with JSON summary files
- fio JSON parsing and per-job metric extraction (IOPS, bandwidth, latency)
- Time-series log parsing with configurable coalesce threshold
- Incomplete-point detection when fewer threads than expected contribute to a sample
- Graph view (`/graphs`) with sidebar filters, foldable sections, chart cards, click-to-maximize
- Compare view (`/compare`) to overlay multiple disks and/or phases on a single chart
- Summary page with aggregated per-disk metrics across phases
- HTML export functionality for sharing benchmark results offline
- `fulldisk: true` in fio job files emits `size=100%`; recorded in fioplot output
- Apache 2.0 license

### Changed

- Removed Criteo-specific naming; codebase is now generic
- Rewrote README to be usage-oriented
- Removed unused YAML config entries (`fioplot` theme/x/y settings, `bbbench.default.template*`)
- Removed `BBBenchConfig.Default` struct (fields were never accessed)
- Trim and blkdiscard phases are hidden by default in both graph views
- Y-axis scaling: baseline at 0 for read-only phases, ceiling at 0 for write-only phases, bidirectional when both read and write data are present

### Fixed

- fio JSON parse failures caused by large-device warning preamble in output
- IOPS aggregation across multiple jobs
- Drive status display (running / complete / pending states, `Device` field population)
- `wait_for` errors across phase boundaries in generated fio job files
- Template rendering bug that caused the orchestrator to find zero jobs
